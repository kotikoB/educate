## Questions for Joe

- Were the pre requisite tasks known before hand?
- writing CPU tracking and scaling scripts from scratch. These are common tasks/problems.
  Have you tried to find scripts online that you can tweak to suit you? Whiting these from scratch can be very time consuming.

## Delivery Manager

- How do you track delivery progress? Because it is not okay to assume things are going on well

## Product Owner

- Were you involved in ticket creation/work planning?
- Which tickets can we do without? How do we prioritize inorder to meet deadlines?

## My Contribution to assist with the problem

### Short Term

- I would investigate the tickets/tasks can we do without, then prioritize those.
- For common tasks like CPU load logging, auto-scaling, CPU tracking and scaling script, I would find pre existing scripts for these and tweak to suit our needs.

## Long Term

I would propose the following changes to our work processes

- Improve Dicovery/Spike process during the planning stage to ensure we do not miss crucial details in the plannig stage, and that everything is accounted for
- Improve tracking and ticketing system.
